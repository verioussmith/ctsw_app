## Reflections 

This tutorial has served to help me understand the strengths that I have currently in Javascript.  At this point I do not nderstand enough to be fluid.  In the beginning of the tutorial i followed along pretty easily but by the end I began to find a few errors. 

One of the errors that I encountered that was not mentioned in the tutorial was the need for me to include the popper.js library based on the condition of me using the CDN version of bootstrap.
